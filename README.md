# Welcome to the BraimIA GitHub Organization!

## Introduction
Welcome aboard! At BraimIA, we're committed to developing robust and clear projects across a variety of services and technologies. Our goal is to collaborate effectively while maintaining high standards of code organization and security.

## Repository Naming Convention
Our repositories follow a structured naming format: **`group-servicename-tech`**. This ensures clarity and consistency across our projects. For example:
- `devops-infra-terraform`: Infrastructure projects by the DevOps team using Terraform.
- `front-publicwebsite-react`: Front-end development for public websites with React.
- `ds-etl-pythoncf`: Data Science ETL processes using Python Cloud Functions.

## Code Practices
- **Self-Documenting Code**: We strive for code that is clear and self-explanatory.
- **Comprehensive READMEs**: Each repository contains a README that guides you through the project, setup, and contribution process.
- **Environment Agnosticism**: Our code is designed to be environment-agnostic. Repositories include a `.env.example` file explaining necessary environment variables and their purpose.
- **Secret Management**: We strictly avoid committing secrets to repositories. Instead, we utilize GCP Secret Manager for handling all sensitive values.

## Getting Started
1. **Explore**: Browse our repositories to understand our work and find areas to contribute.
2. **Adhere to Standards**: Use our naming conventions and follow the established code practices.
