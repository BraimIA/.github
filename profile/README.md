# Welcome to the BraimIA GitHub Organization!

## Introduction
Welcome aboard! At BraimIA, we're dedicated to developing robust and clear projects across a spectrum of services and technologies. We aim for effective collaboration, maintaining high standards of code organization and security.

## Repository Naming Convention
Our repositories follow a structured naming format: **`group-servicename-tech`**. This approach ensures clarity and consistency. Examples include:
- `devops-infra-terraform`: Infrastructure projects by the DevOps team using Terraform.
- `front-publicwebsite-react`: Front-end development for public websites with React.
- `ds-etl-pythoncf`: Data Science ETL processes using Python Cloud Functions.

## Code Practices
- **Self-Documenting Code**: We prioritize code clarity and self-explanation.
- **Comprehensive READMEs**: Each repository contains a detailed README for guidance.
- **Environment Agnosticism**: Our code is universally adaptable, with `.env.example` files to explain necessary environment variables.
- **Secret Management**: We use GCP Secret Manager for secure handling of sensitive values, avoiding committing secrets to repositories.
- **Extended Documentation**: When READMEs or self-documented code aren't sufficient, we turn to GitHub Wiki or docs pages for expansive HTML documentation, ensuring thorough understanding and accessibility.

1. **Explore**: Familiarize yourself with our repositories and find opportunities to contribute.
2. **Follow Standards**: Adhere to our naming conventions and established code practices.
